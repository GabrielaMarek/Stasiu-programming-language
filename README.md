A Python-based interpreter for a custom educational programming language designed to introduce fundamental programming concepts with user-friendly syntax and helpful error messages.

My programming language is almost done—just needs a couple more days to be fully finished. Right now, the parser has print statements for debugging, helping me track its behavior.

To open it, you have to run shell.py

## Features 

- **Variables & Data Types**
  - Numbers (integers/floats)
  - Strings
  - Boolean logic (via 1/0)
- **Control Flow**
  - `when`/`otherwise when`/`in any other case` conditionals
  - `repeat` loops with `from`/`to`/`step`
  - `while` loops
- **Operations**
  - Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`)
  - Comparisons (`>`, `<`, `==`, etc.)
  - Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- **I/O Operations**
  - `display` command for output
- **Error Handling**
  - Visual error highlighting
  - Friendly error messages

 ## Language Syntax Examples:
 
 **Variables can be defined using simple assignment syntax, the language will infer types automatically based on what’s assigned.**
